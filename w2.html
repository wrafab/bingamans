  <h1> CAD and Fusion 360</h1>
   <br>
  <p> During this week we were taught CAD, computer-aided design, and Fusion 360. Fusion is a program used to create CAD. I created many different designs in Fusion(photos below).I also had to create a snap-fit case with groves that allow it to actually close.
