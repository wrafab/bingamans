  <h1>Soldering and Electronics</h1>
  <br>
  <P>This week was very confusing but I think that I have a good grasp on electronics. It was very long and hard process but the hardest was trying to understand all of the pieces and what they do in electronics. Capacitors store energy, transistors are used to switch electronic, Resistors control the amount of energy running throught thr current. LEDs are light admitting diodes and it is a light that has a positive end and a negitive and allows a current to run through it. Diodes allow electric to pass only in one direction. Potentionmeters allow voltage to be split up among three different spotds and it can be adjusted. Breadboards are a base in electronics where everything gets plugged into. Miultimeters are measuring devices for electronics, they measure mostly current, voltage and resistance. A switch is used to switch electronic current in directions or on and off. AC is  anternating current and DC is a direct current in the way they flow. Voltage makes electronic charges move and is measured in volts. Current is the flow of electronic charges. Resistance is the measurment od difficulty in passing electricity throught the current, it is measured in ohms. Soldering was the best part this week. It was really hard to do because you had to make sure that the soldering was not touching. It was also hard becuase you were melting it with a very hot soldering iron.
