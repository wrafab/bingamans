  <h1>Lamination, Vacuim Forming, Molding, and Casting</h1>
  <br>
  <P>The main project this week is to create skateboards. It was extreamly hard and I stuggled a lot. I designed my board for my sister and laser engraved it personal for her. I had to glue it many times because I struggled to seal the bag. After 3 times, I sealed it and was able to get it to form. My next challenge occured while sanding it. While I was sanding it, it cracked along the edge and I had to reglue the part that cracked. After that I had to sand it again and then finally I was able to paint it. I made another mistake, I put a sticker on before I painted it and I really should have just put a sticker on the entire bottom and not even paint it. It turned out nice after the stain was on and it is a gift that my sister loved. The second project was making a mold. It turned out great, and my face made with choclate was so cool. I had to design the object that I wanted to make mold of. I chose to make it my head figuring that it looks great on anything. So we had to use the mold. We had to create a gel to pour into it that made a mold of my face. Then we pored chocolate into it. It looks so cool.</p>
