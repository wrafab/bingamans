  <h1> Final Project</h1>
  <br>
  <p> This week was my last week in digital engineering and we worked on our final projects. My final project in a console for in my kitchen. My mom has been wanting something like this to hold things for years but she never wanted to buy one. So, for her christmas gift she gets what she has wants, a kitchen console. I used UV printing, CAD, laser cutting, 3D printing and woodworking. It took a little bit and a couple of stripped screws but it turned out great. I first had to cut the wood using a saw and then I cut the holes up top using a press drill. I then created the cups to hold things with Fusion 360. It took A while but I finally got the cups the way I wanted them. Later I used the UV printer to print the sayign for the ends of the console. Then I assembled it all. I stripped many screws while putting it together but it turned out nice.
