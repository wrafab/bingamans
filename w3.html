  <h1> UV, T-shirt, and Sublimation Printing</h1>
  <br>
  <p>During this week we used the UV printer, T-shirt printer and the sublimation printer. I got to make a popsocket, water bottle and a t-shirt. It was really cool getting to make all of these things. My favorite is the water bottle. My t-shirt was eay to make, all I really had to do was create the file. The popsocket was also relitivly easy however, I had to wait for the popsockets to arrive and that took a while. My water bottle was the best and the hardest to make. First, I had to design the file on Coreldraw and then print it. The printer is special, it is a sublimation printer which takes the ink and allows in to transfer to other objects with heat. The biggest problem was that the bottle did not fit in a mug press. So, I had to put it in an oven and let it cook on. Taking it out of the oven was hard, It was so hot and I had to take the paper off. It was all worth it to get a cool water bottle customizd for me.
