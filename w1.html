  <h1> Design Challenge </h1>
  
 <p> During the design challenge we had to build a structure from preventing a golf ball to touch the ground. We had straws, limited tape and only three straws could touch the ground. In the second part of the challenge we had to build the tallest newspaper skyscraper.
 My group one both of the challenges with a short standing challenge and wrapping the golf ball with straws.
