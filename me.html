  <h1> About Me </h1>
  
 <p> Hello, my name is Sam Bingaman. I am a student at Western Reserve Academy in the graduating class of 2021.  I am from Pennsylvania and currently live in Hudson, Ohio. I am a football, basketball, and baseball player. Along with my love of sports I like my academic classes. I am excited about taking Digital Engineering and Fabrications. I am excited because I will be using many cool tools and making many new things. Among these things are t-shirts, clocks, skateboards, and laser cutting.
