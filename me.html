  <h1> About Me </h1>
  
 <p> Hello, my name is Sam Bingaman. I am a student at Western Reserve Academy in the graduating class of 2021.  I am from Pennsylvania and currently live in Hudson, Ohio. I am a football, basketball, and baseball player. Along with my love of sports I like my academic classes. I am excited about taking Digital Engineering and Fabrications. I am excited because I will be using many cool tools and making many new things. Among these things are t-shirts, clocks, skateboards, and laser cutting.
  <br>
 Along with playing sports I love watching them too. Among my favorite teams are the Philadephia Eagles. I loved watching them win the Super Bowl this year. I also like the Cleveland Caviliers and the Philadelphia Phillies. My favorite player on the Philadelphia Eagles is the kicker Jake Elliot. He is also one of the best kickers in the NFL winning a game for his team as a rookie with a 61 yard game winning field goal. 
<br>
   So "Fly Eagles Fly."
