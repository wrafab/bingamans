  <h1>Arduino</h1>
  <br>
  <P>We did arduino during this week. Arduino is taking electronics and running it along side code. It is very hard to do and unfortunately one day I did it I kept getting a error message about the board even though it was all set up correctly. There was so much to set up and it took a long time to complete each step. Every once and a while I incorrectly connected the wires in the breadboard and had to restart the entire thing. Arduino is fun but it is also very challenging. For doing it for the first time I think I did good but, with more work comes better knowledge.</P>
