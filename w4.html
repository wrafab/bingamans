  <h1>Laser Cutter</h1>
  <br>
 <p>We finally were able to use the laser cutter. It took a long time but I finally finished. I got to make a clock, bookmark, press fit kit, and a another water bottle. Using the laser cutter takes a long time and you have to wait a while. However, it is really cool watching your design get cut into different materials by a laser. My favorite thing to make was the clock. I will use this a lot and it overall just looks cool. The book mark is one of my favorite designs that I have done in the class. The water bottle is also very cool and turned out nice. The press fit case was hard. You had to know the thickness of the materials and make you cuts that thick. It was a hard design but it turned out cool. After the clock was finished, I had to paint it. The color and texture of the paint turned out very good. All the pictures are below, enjoy them.</p>
