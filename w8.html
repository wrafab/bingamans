  <h1>Sewing and Embroidery</h1>
  <br>
  <P> I never thought in my life I would learn how to sew. However I did, it was not the most fun thing I have done but I made gppd gifts. I embroidered a hat with a WRA logo and I created a holiday pillow case. Backing was used to to allow the thread to pull on it instead of pulling on the hat. On our hats we used a normal backing and a waterproof one ontop of the WRA symbol so it does not break with water. The hardest part about making the pillow case was trying to sew in a straight line. I could not do that at all and at some part at the top accent piece it looks bad. I learned that a sewing machine can go at different speeds and that you control it with a pedel.</P>
