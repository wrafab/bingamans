  <h1>3D Printing and Scanning
  <br>
  <P>I used a 3d printer and scanner for the first time in my life this week. It takes incredibly long, and it is hard to get the designs you want. I had to make something where I scan myself, something that cannot be made subtractivly and something useful. The Makerbot printers we have make additive 3d printed objects. My favorite was the useful object becuase it is something that I use everyday. I created a headphone holder that hangs on a wall. It allows the headphones to hang downward and it is so cool. The object that cannot be subractivley made is a hollow shape that looks like a gold bar. My first object was scanning my face and putting it on something. I put it on a pillar and it looks really cool.
